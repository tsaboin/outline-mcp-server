# Outline MCP Server

![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/outline-mcp-server) • ![downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dy/outline-mcp-server)

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides tools for interacting with [Outline](https://www.getoutline.com/)'s API, enabling AI agents to manage documents, collections, and other entities programmatically through the Outline knowledge base platform.

## Quick Installation

### Claude Desktop

🎉 **`outline-mcp-server` now has an extension for Claude Desktop!**

You can now download a Claude Desktop extension from the [releases page](https://github.com/mmmeff/outline-mcp/releases) for quick and easy setup (just double click it).

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v20 or higher)
- Outline account with API access
- Outline API key with appropriate permissions
- Note: if you need to use the AI-powered ask feature, you must enable the "AI Answers" feature in your Outline Workspace settings

### Running

`outline-mcp-server` supports the latest streamable-http protocol, the deprecated sse protocol, and good ole fashioned stdio.

```bash
# S-HTTP/SSE servers (with optional env var)
OUTLINE_API_KEY=... npx -y outline-mcp-server@latest

# S-HTTP/SSE servers (without env var, use headers for auth)
npx -y outline-mcp-server@latest

# STDIO (requires env var)
OUTLINE_API_KEY=... npx -y --package=outline-mcp-server@latest -c outline-mcp-server-stdio
```

When running HTTP/SSE servers without an environment variable, you'll need to provide the API key in your request headers. The server will display available authentication methods on startup.

### Cursor (mcp.json)

Add the following MCP definition to your configuration:

```json
{
  "outline": {
    "command": "npx",
    "args": ["-y", "outline-mcp-server-stdio@latest"],
    "env": {
      "OUTLINE_API_KEY": "<REPLACE_ME>",
      "OUTLINE_API_URL": "https://app.getoutline.com/api",
      "OUTLINE_MCP_PORT": "6060",
      "OUTLINE_MCP_HOST": "127.0.0.1"
    }
  }
}
```

### Authentication

The Outline MCP server supports two authentication methods:

1. **Environment Variable (Required for stdio mode)**: Set `OUTLINE_API_KEY` as an environment variable
2. **Request Headers (HTTP/SSE modes)**: Provide the API key in request headers

For **stdio mode**, the API key environment variable is required and validated on startup.

For **HTTP/SSE modes**, you have two options:

- Set `OUTLINE_API_KEY` as an environment variable (fallback method)
- Provide API key in request headers (recommended for per-request authentication)

#### Header-based Authentication

When using HTTP/SSE endpoints, you can provide the API key using any of these headers:

- `x-outline-api-key: your_api_key_here`
- `outline-api-key: your_api_key_here`
- `authorization: Bearer your_api_key_here`

If no header is provided, the server will fall back to the `OUTLINE_API_KEY` environment variable. If neither is available, the request will fail with an authentication error.

### Env vars

- `OUTLINE_API_KEY` (_required for stdio, optional for HTTP/SSE_): your API key for outline
- `OUTLINE_API_URL` (_optional_): Alternative URL for your outline API (if using an alt domain/self-hosting)
- `OUTLINE_MCP_PORT` (_optional_): Specify the port on which the server will run (default: 6060)
- `OUTLINE_MCP_HOST` (_optional_): Host/IP to bind the server to (default: 127.0.0.1). Use 0.0.0.0 to bind to all network interfaces

### Usage

Once installed, you can use the MCP server with AI assistants that support the Model Context Protocol, such as Claude via Cursor.

Example queries your AI assistant can now handle:

- "List all the documents in my Outline workspace"
- "Create a new document in the 'Product' collection"
- "Find all documents related to a specific topic"
- "Ask a natural language question about your documents"
- "Create a template from an existing document"
- "Update the content of a document"
- "Add a comment to a document"

## Development

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/mmmeff/outline-mcp.git
cd outline-mcp

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

### Create a `.env` file with your Outline API key:

```
OUTLINE_API_KEY=your_outline_api_key_here

# Optional -------
# OUTLINE_API_URL=https://your-outline-instance.com/api # defaults to https://app.getoutline.com/api
# OUTLINE_MCP_PORT=9001
```

```bash
# Builds/watches the project alongside running @modelcontextprotocol/inspector
npm run dev
```

## Release Process

Releases are fully automated using semantic-release and GitHub Actions. When commits are pushed to the `master` branch, the following happens:

1. The CI pipeline runs tests and builds the package
2. semantic-release analyzes commit messages to determine the next version number
3. A new version is automatically published to npm
4. A GitHub release is created with auto-generated release notes
5. The CHANGELOG.md file is updated

No manual version bumping or release creation is needed.
