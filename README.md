## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Outline account with API access
- Outline API key with appropriate permissions
- Note: if you need to use the AI-powered ask feature, you must enable the "AI Answers" feature in your Outline Workspace settings

### Running directly

```bash
# S-HTTP/SSE servers
OUTLINE_API_KEY=... npx outline-mcp-server@latest -y

# STDIO
OUTLINE_API_KEY=... npx outline-mcp-server-stdio@latest -y
```

### Cursor (mcp.json)

Add the following MCP definition to your configuration:

```json
{
  "outline": {
    "command": "npx",
    "args": ["-y", "outline-mcp-server-stdio@latest"],
    "env": {
      "OUTLINE_API_KEY": "<REPLACE_ME>",
      "OUTLINE_API_URL": "https://app.getoutline.com/api",
      "OUTLINE_MCP_PORT": "6060"
    }
  }
}
```

### Env vars

- `OUTLINE_API_KEY` (_required_): your API key for outline, duh
- `OUTLINE_API_URL` (_optional_): Alternative URL for your outline API (if using an alt domain/self-hosting)
- `OUTLINE_MCP_PORT` (_optional_): Specify the port on which the server will run (default: 6060)

### Usage

Once installed, you can use the MCP server with AI assistants that support the Model Context Protocol, such as Claude via Cursor.

Example queries your AI assistant can now handle:

- "List all the documents in my Outline workspace"
- "Create a new document in the 'Product' collection"
- "Find all documents related to a specific topic"
- "Ask a natural language question about your documents"
- "Create a template from an existing document"
- "Update the content of a document"
- "Add a comment to a document"

## Development

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/mmmeff/outline-mcp.git
cd outline-mcp

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

### Create a `.env` file with your Outline API key:

```
OUTLINE_API_KEY=your_outline_api_key_here

# Optional -------
# OUTLINE_API_URL=https://your-outline-instance.com/api # defaults to https://app.getoutline.com/api
# OUTLINE_MCP_PORT=9001
```

```bash
# Builds/watches the project alongside running @modelcontextprotocol/inspector
npm run dev
```
